- Smart error handling  

---

## 🔹 Part 3 — Predictive Analytics for Cyber Threat Detection  
Script location: `task3_predictive_analytics.py`  
Implements:
- Synthetic dataset  
- Random Forest classification  
- Outputs accuracy + classification report  

---

## 🔹 Part 4 — GitHub Actions CI/CD  
Workflow file: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

Automatically runs:
- AI login test  
- ML predictive model  
- Uploads metrics as artifacts
